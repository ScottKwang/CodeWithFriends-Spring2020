Summary

Throughout Code With Friends, my plan to work was Monday through Fridays and occasionally weekends if I felt like it. Weekdays I planned to force myself to work on the project, but it turned out that I really enjoyed working on it every single day of the week. I created an app that is kind of like a journal to log your experiences during quarantine. This app could be used every day for people who want to jot down any notes about their day. 

Although I didn't finish the app completely, all the basic functionality is finished. I'm just working on extra features like favoriting each note and editing a user's profile.

Inspiration

I was actually planning on developing this app for a few weeks. I think I would've started working on it over the summer if Code With Friends didn't happen. I saw Code With Friends as an opportunity to test my skills and wanted to build something I was proud of. Code With Friends stickers were a bonus incentive for me to try this month.

Challenges

My main problem was balancing my project with school, extracurriculars, and family. I'm still in school and planning to work Monday through Friday while having midterms was a challenge. I managed my time very well and I had to sacrifice some leisure time to get things done.

Reflections
(1. What did you learn during this process (whether that be technical skills, or new things you learned about yourself, time management, etc?)
I learned a lot about my abilities as an iOS developer. I've always wanted to become a professional iOS developer and creating this project by myself was a challenge I had never done before. I was able to understand iOS more by building than looking at someone else's code.

(2. What would you have done differently if you could do it again?)
I think I should have worked with someone else on this app. I think collaborating with someone would've made the process a lot more fun and a group of people could complain about simple bugs that took hours to fix.

(3. What resources did you find most helpful in working on your project?)
I mainly read medium articles and looked at the official documentation. I utilized Firebase so I mainly used the documentation to build my app. I also looked back on apps I've created before to see how I implemented certain elements in my project. Sometimes I would watch videos to have a better conceptual understanding of what I was doing.

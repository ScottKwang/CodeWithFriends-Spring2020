# Summary:

The snake game is the classic game that you play on Google in your free time. Knowing that we have a lot of time in quarantine, I figured that it would be fun to develop a game like this just to pass by some time. This was a project that was created with Javascript.

# Insipiration:

Soo... I honestly wanted to take the time for Coding with Friends to just personally learn javascript. I'm a new developer, and I wanted to just get my hands past just introductory Java and Python in my classes. I basically took and learned from YouTube videos most of the time and finally put it together into a website. 

# Challenges:

It was hard to keep to a schedule especially with being in school as well. I ended up working a lot on the project last minute (to get the sticker!) and not adding too much personality to my project. I still got lots to learn!


# Reflections:

1. Learned to better schedule my independent learning (procrastinate less!)
2. YouTube is my best friend.
3. Stick with the topic, and eventually you'll get it

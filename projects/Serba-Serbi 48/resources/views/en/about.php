Hi ... Welcome to the column about Serba-Serbi 48 </br>
Starting from the number of hoaxes that spread quite a lot and the ease of sharing information on one website page. In addition, the existence of "Code With Friends" from Mayuko Inoue and Scott Kwang, made this website even more driven in its making. <br>
This website is made by Fadhillah, a 22-year-old novice programmer and has just explored things about websites by creating websites that have the PHP programming language (Laravel Framework) gradually. Fadhillah, who has oshi Miyawaki Sakura (HKT48) and Shani Indira (JKT48), aims to provide general information about 48 groups and 46 groups and is presented with a simple and attractive appearance, and to stay away from things that are false news. <br>
Thanks to Stage 48 (general information providers such as wikipedia for 48 groups), instagram admin @ alliance_jkt48, and some of Fadhillah's friends who are also fans of 48 groups. </br>
Indeed, currently there are still many shortcomings in this website such as the appearance that is still very simple and many functions that are still not well coordinated. However, we will still change the website for the better. </br>
Thank you ^^

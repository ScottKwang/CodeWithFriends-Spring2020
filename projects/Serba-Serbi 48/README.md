Summary :
The condition of the corona virus pandemic that is currently sweeping the world, I can focus more on maturing myself to be able to use many programming languages that seem to be seen from the job market much needed by companies in Indonesia.
In about 1 month, I learned about creating websites from the server and client sides. For that reason, I study the PHP programming language (especially Framework Laravel) HTML Native and CSS Native (especially Bootstrap), and SQL (especially MySQL and PostgreSQL).
The "Serba-Serbi 48" project was created to enable people (48 groups) to get rid of boredom at home by looking at websites that contain information about 48 groups (for example: about akb48, etc.) and do not contain false news, and are made in a manner simple in one page.

Inspiration :
This project was inspired by several things. The first thing is because there is a need to backup information about 48 groups, a forum (stage48.net) that provides complete information about 48 groups suddenly experiences errors and results in the loss of a lot of data about 48 groups. The problem is that the backup data is only from the fans' social media.
The second thing is because I want to make a website that looks simpler (than stage48.net) and contains a lot of things that fans usually look for such as personal data, song lyrics, interesting info, and personnel photos in a container so that it's easy to find by fans .

Challenges :
1. I only learned things about website creation in 2-3 months (Mar 20-May 20). Although the concept of logical thinking (even though it's not about technical website creation) has been obtained from campus (I just graduated from college with a major in computer engineering), but because of the things learned on campus are very little and lack of time when on campus because there are too many things learned, made me (like) learn linking websites from the beginner
2. The complexity of the website is quite large
3. I can't think enough to make a good web design

Reflections :
1. I learn about how to design website, learn php (native language and language) for use in the crud function, log in and synchronize both, learn bootstrap to make good look and make a website that can be accessed properly on the desktop ( hp, etc.), and learn basic SEO things like meta tags.
2. I will be more effective in doing time estimates for website creation, from designing, creating pages, and aligning everything.
3. Resource I have find and that's helpful for me are some videos and articles tutorial to making simple websites and for learner syntax programs (in English and Indonesian), heroku + github for deploy web sites and Laravel for making programs

How To Run in Localhost:
1. Install XAMPP (For run php my admin + to utilize php.exe)
2. Install Composer (For run laravel)
3. Run in cmd "composer global require laravel/installer" (For install Laravel)
4. Run in cmd (in Laravel's folder) "composer require laravel/ui" and "php artisan ui vue --auth" for have authentication laravel
5. Download this project and copy to laravel's file (delete files that have the same folder name as this project before)
6. Run in cmd "php artisan serve" and click file "xampp_start" in xampp file for show this project in localhost(:8000)

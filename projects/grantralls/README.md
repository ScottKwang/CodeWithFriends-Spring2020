## Mission
During my job search for that coveted first Software Engineering position. I found three types of jobs. The first was obviously made by someone in HR who isn't too sure how to draft a Software Engineering job posting so I hesitate to apply. The second is a job posting where they expect the candidate to be practically a whole IT team. The third kind of job is a reasonable, well written, posting. What if there was an app to sift through all of that for you? Also the amount of irony of when a interviewer says "Tell me about a project you worked on." and I respond with "Let me tell you about the one that reccomended me this position" is just too incredible of an opportunity to pass up! The whole "app" is controlled through texting. Partly because I thought it had a "uniqueness" factor but mostly because I love backend and I didn't want to waste time writing a bunch of CSS. Text it is!

## Technical Summary
This project was built with Typescript with Express as the backend technologies. Twilio's APIs were used for sending and receiving texts. AWS Lambda functions were used to run the backend server. AWS DynamoDB was used to store information. Typedoc was used for documentation purposes.

## Challenges
The biggest technical hurdle was setting up AWS Cloud Formation which is a tool to provision cloud infrastructure and resources using code. It's *fun*... but complex. My absolutely favorite challenge in this project was writing cleaner code. I'm currently a Junior Level Computer Science student and I learned such an incredible amount of useful information in my programming class last year. My code definitely is not perfect by any stretch of the imagination but it has come a long way in such a short time all thanks to my incredibly skilled programming professor. He is never afraid to slow down and explain why he wrote something the way he did. 

## Reflections
The thing I would have done differently is used a project management tool to keep my thoughts and progress together. There were a couple of times where I saw some tool and said "ooooh shiny!" and got distracted. My takeaway for this project is a boost to my confidence as a developer. When I ran into an issue, I didn't just throw it off to the side and give up. I picked myself up, sat down, and read some documentation. I've gotten used to reading documentation already but this was the first time I've done it for a major project. I understand that I'm not a programming genius and I may not have all the answers but I see in myself a deeper value that can be brought into most teams. I have a deeper well of tenacity than I thought I had. I'm not afraid to say "I have no **blasted** idea how to handle this but by the end of this work session I'm going to have it figured out" when before it went more along the lines of "I don't know how to solve this, I'm a pretty sad excuse of a developer". I've made a couple jokes but I want to be serious here. I want to say a *huge* thank you to Scott and Mayuko! This fun little project has made a lasting impact on me as a growing engineer. I hope my challenges and reflections will have an impact on others.

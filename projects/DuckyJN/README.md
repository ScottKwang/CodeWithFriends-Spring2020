# ToDoList API

Far from finished creating my project (10%), but I have learned a good amount on writing an API with Ruby on Rails. It taught me that writing a REST API recommends passing values as a JSON string. During work, I did not have to pass any values as a JSON string before, so it was all new to me.

The other thing that I learned is to write cleaner tests and that it may even be longer than code used for the actual application.

### Technologies
- Ruby 2.7.1
- Rails 6.0.2

## Upcoming
I plan to continue working on this project and finish before the next CWF.

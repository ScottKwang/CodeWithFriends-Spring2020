## Overview
[![wilsonj806](https://circleci.com/gh/wilsonj806/react-headless-press-blog.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/wilsonj806/react-headless-press-blog)

This is a quick gardening blog that'll be built with React for the frontend and headless Wordpress as the CMS. Since it's a blog, we're going to need to add content, so that's where Wordpress comes in. App deployment will be done in AWS at the end and there'll be some form of automated testing and deployments done.

## Current Progress
- Bare minimum landing page
- CircleCI based deploy of the React app to S3

## Additional Docs
As this is a learning project, additional documentation can be found below. Hope it helps on your coding journey!

## Basic Requirements
Here are the basic requirements for this project:
- it needs to use React for the front end
- it needs to use Wordpress as the CMS
- the final app needs to be on Amazon Web Services

Not much to it, but there's a lot of room to grow this in complexity.

## Learning Objectives
The learning objectives for this project are simple. I want to learn how to deploy a moderately complex application to AWS, and I want to learn to use Wordpress. Kubernetes is kind of a bonus, but also would be nice and I'd be learning SSH and Linux concepts/ topics as a direct result of deploying to AWS.

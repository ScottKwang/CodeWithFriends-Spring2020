## Inspiration
The idea for the app came when Mayuko and Scott inspired me with the Theme "Quarantine Improvement". 

Once quaratine kicked-in, I started using various Online Music Streaming Services. The issue though was the constant switching between those apps in my TV. Using the TV Remote, the switch took multiple button presses and searching music was also a huge pain in the non-intuitive UI. So, I thought of integrating the services into one single app and cast my favorite songs and playlists with just a click of a button.

## Packages/Stack Used
    1. React Native.

## Summary

(Write a short, 1-2 paragraph summary of what you did for Code With Friends this month)

During Code With Friends Spring 2020, I decided to make a Shopping List app. I wasn't particularly fond of the existing options on the App Store (either they had ads, or were too feature-heavy), so I decided to make my own! I had my brother Ray (www.linkedin.com/in/rayinoue) mock up some designs for me, and decided to write the app using SwiftUI (Apple's new UI framework) in the spirit of learning something new.

During Code With Friends Spring 2020, I wanted to make an Android app because I was learning Android development. I was watching an Android tutorial and the instructor was creating an app to practice math. I was inspired with the design and modified the idea to practice common words for foreign languages. I created the app with Android Studio and Java, and created a simple C++ script to help parse data from https://1000mostcommonwords.com

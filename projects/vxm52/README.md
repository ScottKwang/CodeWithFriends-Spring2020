# Summary:

Touch typing is the act of typing without looking at your keyboard. This quaratine we wanted to help people improve their touch typing skills. In this game you can score points by being able to identify keyboard keys correctly within the time limit set by you. This is a project created in HTMl, CSS, and JavaScript.

We are beginner developers. Sumer wrote his first "Hello World" statement at the beginning of this month. He ended up coding most of the functionality (JS side) of the game. Vaibhav has been programming for a bit longer. Go easy on us üòÅ!


# Insipiration:

We watched some competitive programming videos on YouTube and noticed that programmers never look at their keyboards while typing. So we thought why not make something that helps people improve their touch typing during the free time they have in quarantine.


# Challenges:

We decided to redesign the whole project twice so we had to make adjustments.


# Reflections:

1. Sumer learned how to code. Vaibhav got better at CSS.
2. Add more features. Improve the layout.
3. w3schools, MDN Docs, and YouTube.

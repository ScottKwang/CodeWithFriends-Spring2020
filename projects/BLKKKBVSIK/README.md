## CWF Related

Firstly, thank you @helloMayuko and @scottkwang for this event ! I was more than pleased to try myself at improving and chassing after betterness.

With CFW, I learned quite some things:
  - I explored all possible targets using Flutter (Windows, Unix, MacOS, iOS, Android, Web), unfortunetely in order to play the audio file, I rely on a package that is compatible only for iOS/MacOS/Android/Web, that's why I didn't include all the other versions.

  - I discovered a lot of packages and also explore the beta update of my languages Dart & Flutter

  - I started [to write articles](https://dev.to/blkkkbvsik/) on my favorite technology on dev.to, and it feels amazing and I wish I could have started before !

  - I tried to be more consistent on my personal projects and also started a Twitter to share more with the community.

Thank you again ! It was truely a pleasure to participate.
Kinds regards from France,
BLKKKBVSIK AKA Enzo Conty.

## TODO

  - I should add support for audio services on Android and iOS.

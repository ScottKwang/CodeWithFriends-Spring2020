# Dino Run Game, similar to the Chrome T-Rex Run Game.

Created by <a href="https://github.com/epsi95">Probhakar</a>,

## Summary

I learnt the basics of game development. I got to know Discord which is a great place after Stack Overflow and it is just because of CWF. I happened to join many groups, people are very helpful. This project helps me to
- understand subtle concepts in flutter
- learnt using the Flame game engine
- created all game assets by myself (except audio). It was great fun creating animation and raster images (Thanks to Figma)
- I never stretched any project over one month. I used to finish them within 3-4 days. It used to harm my health. But by participating in code with friend, I can now distribute my task over a longer period.

Final Output: Please refer to the "STEP3_out_put" folder.

## Inspiration

Due to COVID-19, I created one mobile application which can be found here https://github.com/epsi95/covid-reporter, But google turned down my app saying legal issue. I was sad. Then I though I never tried game development. So I wanted to start with something simple and fun. So I thought to make T-Rex run game. The only twist I added is that you can control the jump using your voice!

## Challenges

- Flame game engine is new for me. I had to read through the documentation a lot.
- Screen sizes affects game in a big way, I need to tweek game parameters based on screen sizes.

## Reflections

1. I learnt 2D game development basics

2. Flame official documentation, Flame discord channel, Jap Alekhin's tutorials and moreover the conducive environment of CWF2020 was a great aid for this project.

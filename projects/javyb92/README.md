## Summary

What I did this month is create a basic Weather app, added Geolocation and a neat little feature that determines wheter or not it is the best time
to go on a run. This is a foundation for hopefully something bigger after building upon it in the future that I can officially release in some way

## Inspiration

I'm an runner, that runs quite a bit. Now many of us (me in my early years) running don't care about how the weather is out side or think we can just slap on a bit of 
sunscreen and we will be both protected and perform at our very best. Sometimes, that isn't the case, so I  made this little thing that will
will be expanded into something that'll actually help us run at our very best, when it's best outside so we can push ourselves with weather
being the smallest factor against our performance.

I wanted to make something with no bootstrap, rare use of fontawesome and showcase stuff I can make from scratch (See those nifty icons? Me. Paint.NET. Ha ha.)

## Challenges

Came out of BootCamp right before I participated with coding with friends, I took 2-3 weeks relearning what I learned before CWF was launch and thought it wouldbe a great opportunity 
to really hone my skills without the need typing along a project on a udemy coure, I believe we learn better on our own and don't copy along.

So being exactly 5 months into coding and being knowledge dumped of alll of these cool concepts and practices it was rough for me to create this
and stay on a schedule with React because I ran into issues of course new people would make. I wasn't discouraged, I've lost days to the simplest of errors but I'm learning, and now to think about it, 
all the errors I got are pretty silly now. Physically I forget to eat sometimes, but I go run anayways, so time management with recovery is important.

## Reflections

(1. What did you learn during this process (whether that be technical skills, or new things you learned about yourself, time management, etc?)
I've learned how to use React Hooks better, I really solidified certain small practices and habits from when I took a few weeks to relearn everything and applied it here. I'm a better
coder for that for sure. Having the chat as well as Mayuko vibing with us (when I'm jokingly demanding her about hosting 24 Hour Valorant streams), felt nice
having people there to interact there, as I really don't have anyone I know outside of class to code stuff. It helped me stay productive.

(2. What would you have done differently if you could do it again?)
Not use OpenWeather Api, use Yahoo instead. Open Weather just does.... things that I dont want it to do. (If you look at my gifs, the "Los" can be higher than the hi on forecasts, no go)
While the Yahoo API is a lot more organized and not jarring. For sure set up environments in Github Pages and Heroku from the beginning, seriously, trying to
get this deployed and a running demo has me chasing down a lot of stuff needed to hopefully get a presentable demoto link on this readme.

(3. What resources did you find most helpful in working on your project?)
Old class lectures, stacked overflow, the official documentation and the discord for morale boost.

##The Future

I intend on releasing this for free (On Google Play) to have something on my name and say that I did it. But several things have to be done first.

<b>Fixes</b>: Too many. 

<b>Major Features Planned</b>:

1) Run Checker - User checks the block a logs in the day if they ran for the day or not, they'll be able to log miles to.

2) Run Status - After user checks the block for the day, the information displays of the last week, green boxes if ran, red if they didn't.

3) In Depth Forecast - Each day would have a status, if the user clicks on that day, there would be an hourly update of that day selected, for the user to find out what best hours to run in.

4) The Backend - A user/sign up page Save total user mileage, create a default or list of areas for quick searching. Still thinking this one through.

That's all folks

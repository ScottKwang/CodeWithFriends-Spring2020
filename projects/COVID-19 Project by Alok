Hey you guy's

It's an application from my side and please don't mind I started this few days before the announcement for myself just for fun.

So it's an android application which tells the user how much this COVID-19 pandemic affected the world till now.
Features:
  1. Live update regarding the disease like total affected people, deaths, recovered.
  2. Live update contrarywise also.
  
 Thank you for all the motivation to moving forward, thank you.
 Best

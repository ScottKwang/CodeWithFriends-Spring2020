# Musiotic

Musiotic is a Digital Audio Workstation (DAW) allowing new music producers to get started with making music!
Our goal was to allow for people with little to no musical experience to be able to understand how to use
the application and start putting together notes and rhythms. 

Each song is created in phases, starting with a style selection. For the Code With Friends project we only
worked on implementing a Piano style, but we are planning on implementing more styles soon!

After creating a song, the user can export their work to a MIDI file which can be listened to on
Windows Media Player or similar. Screenshots and a demo of the application is below!

Jar or executable file coming soon! The lib directory has the dependencies we used
to run the application. We use Openjdk14 (not included).

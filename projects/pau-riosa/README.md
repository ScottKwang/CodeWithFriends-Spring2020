## Summary

(Write a short, 1-2 paragraph summary of what you did for Code With Friends this month)

For the Code with Friends, I intended to learn React-native plus integrating Elixir as the backend.

(Insert any pictures or screenshots of your final project here)

## Inspiration

(What inspired, motivated, or urged you to work on this project specifically?)

Twinkle Teeth is a working in progress pet project of mine written in React-Native and Elixir.
I intended to build this app for my dentist friend because she always wanted to have her own app
that can manage appointment, messages, attachments etc.

## Challenges

(What challenges did you encounter - technical, mental, logistical, physical - while working on your project?)

As I observed, I think I struggle mentally because of some instances during this quarantine season. I lost my job 
and I couldn't concentrate further. But still I tried to work on some task for my project. 

Second I observed that I was eager to build a big app without having an idea of thinking I could finish it or not. 
Actually I was hoping to finish this one within a month but I guess I was wrong with my estimation.

Overall I believed there is still more room to improved especially on project management, estimation, dedication 
and determination on whatever you're doing.

## Reflections

(1. What did you learn during this process (whether that be technical skills, or new things you learned about yourself, time management, etc?)

First I was happy because I was able to built a react-native app from scratch. Second I think I need to improve my time management, dedication and
heart on whatever I am doing. Also commit to what you have planned and make sure that you will finish it no matter how big or small a project.

(2. What would you have done differently if you could do it again?)

I think I could finish the project if I have small scope that I had worked on. Able to imagine and vision what I could finish with a span of time.

(3. What resources did you find most helpful in working on your project?)

The resources that I find most helpful was reading the docs and reading some e-books.

## Summary

A React Native app to help my family keep track of our birds and all necessary info about them, such as family relations, if they are currently laying eggs, when they started doing so, etc. All the data is hardcoded at the moment but will switch to a better solution when I have time.

These screenshots are not the best quality, but this is the home page that just displays a list of all the birds we currently have (please forgive my non-existent design skills):

Tapping on one of them opens a detail screen which gives information about gender, age, color and family - I might add data about nutrition at some point if I find it useful.

This screen shows which birds are currently breeding, the date they started and how many eggs they layed:

The third tab is still emtpy, I was considering the idea of adding some sort of predictions about baby birds colors... or maybe I'll find something a bit more useful :D

## Inspiration

Breeding season. That's it. :D
It's easy to keep an eye on them when you have a few birds but it stops being easy when you have 10+ of them, some even looking very much alike. You have to avoid birds mating with their siblings or parents, which can very easily happen, and it can be hard to remember all the familial relationships.

## Challenges

To be honest, the only challenge I faced is finding the time to work on the project. Weekends unfortunately only last two days and apparently resting is good for your health? :P
Also, I designed my own icons, just for fun. Not sure I had that much fun in the end ðŸ˜…

## Reflections

So there's this one little thing, not really related to technical learning but still:

The reversed rounded corners on this header. It's easy and it took me about 10 minutes, but as I completed it I realized a few months ago I would have been terrified by the idea that I'd have to make such a custom shape. So yeah, nice realization ðŸ™‚

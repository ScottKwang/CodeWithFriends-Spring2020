# Summary
Around that time when Scott and Mayuko were launching CWF my country was having a lockdown due to Covid19, and I was pretty free because I just finished all my bachelor degree classes, waiting for my results. So I started to learn React and .NetCore, this is my first project for both! I'm very happy to be able to share with everyone here!

# Features
- Masonry layout!
- Easy drag and drop like any Kanban Board
- Able to view all lists and cards in one page
- Fast and lightweight

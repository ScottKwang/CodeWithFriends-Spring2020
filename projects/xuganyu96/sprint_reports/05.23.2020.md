# 05.23.2020 Spring Report
#### 05.17.2020 - 05.23.2020
All tickets shipped this week revolved around developing the `Admin Tool `app, which allows system administrator to run Python script from a web interface, without having to access server's side kernel, at all.
* [Issue 26: Admin Tools workflow design](https://github.com/xuganyu96/PyArchive/issues/26)
* [Issue 28: Admin Tools home page websocket](https://github.com/xuganyu96/PyArchive/issues/28)
* [Issue 30: Admin Tools 'develop' view](https://github.com/xuganyu96/PyArchive/issues/30)
* [Issue 32: Admin Tools 'detail' and 'delete' view](https://github.com/xuganyu96/PyArchive/issues/32)

By completing the four tickets above, the life cycle of "Admin Tool" is complete, with the following features:
* sysadmin can write and test-run Python script as if it was running in Django shell
* sysadmin can save the script, which allows him to execute the script through a single button click from the "Admin Tools" app's home page
* sysadmin can review the source code of the script in a detail view, and delete it if the script is no longer needed; at which point, the admin tool's card will disappear from the home screen, as well.

The coming two weeks as I intend to wrap the project up, I will focus on deployment strategy and presentation.

# 05.16.2020 Spring Report
#### 05.10.2020 - 05.16.2020
Two tickets were shipped this week:
* [Issue 22: Development Reset Script](https://github.com/xuganyu96/PyArchive/issues/22)
* [Issue 24: Admin Tools Console Prototype](https://github.com/xuganyu96/PyArchive/issues/24)

A couple of things that I have learned this week:
* I can install `django-extensions` and add `django_extensions` as an installed app to the project setting. This enabled me to write Python scripts in a `scripts` folder and use `python manage.py runscript <script_name>` to invoke the `run()` method of the script. This is better than scripting things outside the Django framework because it avoids having to instantiate project settings.
* Websocket is a lot of fun and provides an upgrade from HTTP that enables me to create persistent connections and elements on web that can update in real time, while previously I need to refresh the page to get new information.

Things to look foward to next week:
* With the technological foundation laid, I can begin to design the `admintools` framework and implement a few of them as things go.

# Go Fish with Hannah the Clown Fish

Created by Angelina, linkedin.com/in/angelina-brasen

## Summary

I created a game of Go Fish that is played without a GUI. The user plays against an AI called Hannah the Clown Fish, and the person with the most pairs when one person has run out of cards in their hand wins!

## Inspiration

I wanted to create a game using some sort of AI so that I have something to play with while bored in quarantine. It makes it so much better that I coded the game I play.

## Challenges

There was one time where the code would not compile and it took me a whole weekend to figure out what was wrong. I overthought the error when it was very simple. This took a mental toll on me and I had to take a break before continuing my project.

## Reflections

I learned what 'enum' means in Java, as well as what I am capable of with the coding knowledge I have learned in the past year, since this was my first year learning Java. I also learned how difficult it can get when having an error in your code and needing to fix it on your own. That was not a situation I had when I was learning Java in the classroom. 

I would not have changed much, but I would like to learn about GUI before school starts again so that I can create a user-friendly interface for my game.

I referred alot to other Go Fish code game to have an idea of what type of algorithms and classes I need to create.

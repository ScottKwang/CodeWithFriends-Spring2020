# Discrete Event Simulator
Created by Haikal, source code here: https://github.com/waffledood/SideProjects

Hey Mayuko & Scott, this was based off a school assignment where we had to set up a Discrete Event Simulator to simulate the environment of a shop 
where Servers serve incoming Customers! I just made some changes so that it prompts the user for the correct input of values & looked a bit
more presentable haha :P Also, I realized this isn't exactly following the theme of Quarantine Improvement... but I'm pretty new to
programming & haven't had the time to explore much but I hope you guys find this nifty some way or another :D

## Summary
This is a program to help simulate a Discrete Event Simulator that models an environment where Servers server incoming Customers & prints 
each event in accordance to the time the event occurs.

## Inspiration
The assignment set by my Prof! :P

## Challenges
This was a huge jump from the previous coding knowledge I had prior to taking this CS class (my 2nd CS class) in college. Before this, 
I only had knowledge in C & took some time to self-learn some basic Java!

## Reflections
This needs to be run locally on one's computer so I'm hoping to shift this into a program or server running this code on the innerwebz so 
it can function as an applet.

## Usage
To try it out, just compile & run it from the command line! (javac ./cs2030/simulator/*.java to compile the files inside the cs2030 package!)

## Summary

For this event, I decided to create a shopping list app that would encourage mindful shopping of clothes, items, and groceries. I coded the app using Flutter on Android Studio, and the coding lanuage I used was Dart. What I have done so far of this app is not much really. So far, what I'm submitting is a basic home page by using the basic title bar, body and action button using Flutter Widgets. Although this is a really really dry and basic app at the moment, it is the very first app I've ever created!! :) 

The initial goal of this project was to create a shopping list/diary app that would help you make mindful choices when your shopping or window shopping. The app would allow you to create different shopping list categories such as clothes, tech, grocereies, etc. For each item in a category (items can be a string name or a photo picture), you can have an option to write jot notes beside it that reminds you of why item is listed in the first place, what makes you want to buy it, what you plan on doing with it if you got it, and althernative options or prices if you discover any before you buy it. There would also be another section of the app where you could write a personal opition/review/experience of a purchased item (very similar to the rate/review section of online sites). The point of this section is to reflect/remind you of which items worked and would buy again, which didn't work, etc.

## Inspiration

Honestly since COVID-19 happened, I've noticed that I spend a lot of my time window shopping virtually and buying things I really didn't  need/wanted lol! Being quarantined and off from school (and still job hunting) made me more bored and sometimes I like to window shop all day when I'm bored (which is exciting, but can get carried away). 

To help manage impulsive spending and stuck fantacies about things I don't have (yet), I thought that having a shopping list/diary app would help me make realistic choices about things I plan on buying, and honest opinions of what I purchased so I could try shopping more with a purpose.

## Challenges
I was stuck for a while on why I could not get an emulator to run to test my app vurtually, but then I realized that my Windows Home PC processor is an AMD. Android Studio seemed to autimatcally work for intel processor PCs with HAXM installed. But after a couple days I found out that I needed to enable Windows Hypervisor Platform on my computer and the problem was solved :) 

## Reflections

1. Problem Solving Skills:
-Google is your best friend if you're stuck on coding/installation problems 
-I found that writing down (pen/paper) of what I plan to get done and then putting that blue print/pseudo-code into real Dart code helps get stuff done faster/easier/less-stressfull

2. Time Management:
-code for 20 mins and take 10 min breaks help me
-Coding during the day, I'm not a night owl (lol)

3. If I were to do this project again, I think I would take it in smaller baby steps. I think that if I set goals to accomplish different aspects in my project little by little (like even just get a title bar done in one day) then I believe I would feel less stressed about coding my app. I went in with a mindset of getting entire functional sections of my app done each day. But this was my first time making an app and first time coding in Dart, I would take baby steps and reward small accomplisments next time :) 

4. Helpful Resourses for Working on My Project:
-This person's Flutter videos!  https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4cUxeGkcC9jLYyp2Aoh6hcWuxFDX6PBJ
-Mayuko's chill co-coding stream (not directly on my project, but made me more productive with voice-over of Mayuko coding and chatting with chill music :)

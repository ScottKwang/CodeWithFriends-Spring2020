# Convolutional Neural Network Cheat Sheet

1. Load the data
2. Analyze it in order to normalize ( mean and stddev zero )
3. Preprocess ( apply any normalization, one hot encode the labels if needed )
4. Create a model
5. Separate the data into train and test
6. Train the model and validate it
7. Evaluate it

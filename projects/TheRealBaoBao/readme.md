The game is basically a clone version of the google tic-tac-toe game, but the game's design is way much simpler. Try winning the impossible AI, I never have beaten it before so good luck with that! Haha! Let me explain to you.

What is Tic Tac Toe?

Tic-tac-toe is a game made for two players, X, and O in a 3x3 grid setting. The player who gets three of their marks in a line (horizontally, diagonally, or vertically) wins. Tic-tac-toe is built on a minimax algorithm which is a recursive algorithm that is used to choose an optimal move for a player assuming that the opponent is also playing optimally.

Into the AI part. The impossible ai of this game is the key, and our brains of course. Based on a starting combination, we could describe the moves into a tree diagram with three movements. And two of those have another three and two of those three have another two movements. So in total 7 movements for that combination. This is a minimax algorithm because you have two players whos making an optimizing movement. X is maximizing sometimes and o is maximizing, X may also be minimizing as well as o. In order to make this AI unbeatable, we must make it always maximize and O minimizing.

I know this might be confusing, I was confused at first and I am bad at explaining so I am sorry If I confused you.

I was inspired by a machine learning youtube video explaining tic-tac-toe. I immediately got interested and pumped up.

During building the app, I had a lot of difficulties setting up the AI for the game. That took me a month to learn and I went through numerous YouTube tutorials.

However, in the end, I was able to get the solutions in and build a simple project. The CSS is really bad looking right now, I will try to fix that later one. In the progress, I learned a lot of JavaScript skills such as finally understanding a for loop statement, got a good sense of how tic-tac-toe is built, and much more. If I have done it more differently, I would have made the CSS way better and probably add some juice to the whole project. Youtube vids were helpful as well as online articles.

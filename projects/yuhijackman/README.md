# Booksaver

A visual reminder of how much unread books on your bookshelf are worth and helps you stop letting books pile up unread.

# Why I made this.
I felt like I need something that motivates me to pick up unfinished books on my bookshelf once again, when I saw tons of books on my bookshelf.
And I noticed many of the books aren't read through to the end.

I believe that I'm not the only person who has started dozens of books and never finished them.
So I decided to create this app.

## Summary
Book-saver is a visual reminder of how much unread books on your bookshelf are worth and helps you stop letting books pile up unread.
I built it for Code With Friends.

## Inspiration and why I made this.
I felt like I need something that motivates me to pick up unfinished books on my bookshelf once again, when I saw tons of books on my bookshelf.
And I noticed many of the books aren't read through to the end.

I believe that I'm not the only person who has started dozens of books and never finished them.
So I decided to create this app.

## Challenges
Fetch book data from an external API on SPA was a bit of challenge.
I created it with Nuxt.js and Firebase as a SPA.
And I needed to request a resource that has a different origin to fetch book data.
Of course It's against CORS policy.
So I had to think about how to make it possible.

I decided to use a Netlify function as a place where all the requests to an external API is hit.

## Reflections

1. What did you learn during this proces
  - No SQL Data Modeling since I had zero experience of using it.
  - Atomic Desing.
  - Importance of finishing a project. I've tried to build many projects before but I always lost motivation and impetus halway through. The reason why I could finish it this time is because I have a clear purpose which is submitting it to CWF.
 
2. What would you have done differently if you could do it again?
  I would build API with Laravel and stop relying on firebase and Netlify.

3. What resources did you find most helpful in working on your project?
  Official documentation for Firebase and Vue.js.

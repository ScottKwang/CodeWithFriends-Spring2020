# (ShareIT)

Basically it is an application where people can share any files they want with other users (you can view it following the link to deployed app).

Clients can find each other by searching for the user by his name, then they can write them a comment in private chat and ask for the id (this id allows to find the account's files), after getting the id the user can find the files and download or view them in the browser.

(Essentially, this is a simplified version of Google Drive Platform)

To start using app you need to register with a real email on the main page of the app.

If you do not want to register an email or the registration form does not work, you can use already registered accounts:
1) login: yidoj97949@provlst.com
   password: 111111
   name: User1

2) login: xoxipef981@provlst.com
   password: 111111
   name: User2

3) login: sewov58461@whowlft.com
   password: 111111
   name: User3

After getting into an account you can:
1) Upload and store your files
2) Search for the files of a user (if you have his id)
3) Get your own id and share it with others
4) Search for a user by his name
5) After getting at least one user name you can start a private conversation with him as well as ask for his id or provide your own to share the files the account has
6) After searching for the user's files you can easily download them

## Challenges

The main challenges were to connect socket.io to make the chat logic work correctly and to find enough time for coding while studying in school.

## Reflections
Any thoughts?

First, I was working on another project, it was the Cooking app that is a complete Full Stack App. I was to ambitious to get it done in time. This is my first big application due to the lack of expirience I was struggling with React development part. Realizing that I do not have enough time I started developing this small project)

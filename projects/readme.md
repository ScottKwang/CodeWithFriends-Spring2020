Tic- Tac- Toe Game

The project was created by Linfeng Bao, you could call me Henry.

The game is basically a clone version of the google tic-tac-toe game, but the game's design is way much simpler. Try winning the impossible AI, I never beaten it before so good luck with that! Haha! 

I was inspired by a machine learning youtube video explaining tic-tac-toe. I immediately got interested and pumped up. 

During building the app, I had a lot of difficulties setting up the AI for the game. That took me a month to learn and I went through numerous YouTube tutorials.

However, in the end, I was able to get the solutions in and build a simple project. The CSS is really bad looking right now, I will try to fix that later one. In the progress, I learnt a lot of JavaScript skills such as finally understanding a for loop statement, got a good sense of how tic-tac-toe is build and much more. If I have done it more differently, I would have made the CSS wayy better and probably add some juice to the whole project. Youtube vids were helpful as well as online articles.

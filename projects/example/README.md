# FightPandemics

Created by a group of volunteers,
Source code: https://github.com/FightPandemics/FightPandemics

## Summary

I've volunteered in a project for fighting the current pandemic. This project aims to build a community where people can request help or offer help to others! My role in this project is Frontend Engineer working on the web app. The current staging server can be found here: https://staging.fightpandemics.work/

## Inspiration

I was looking for a job for a month during the pandemic and faced multiple rejections. I've decided to use this time to focus
on my skills instead! I found an opportunity to make good use of my skills by volunteering in this project which can be very helpful
for people who are in need!

## Challenges

I was quite rusty in React as I missed a few updates on React, so picking up React was exciting and challenging. Contributing in a very big project with a lot of other volunteers is very challenging as well, most people are beginners so we are not sure if this is the "right" way to do it. 

## Reflections

I've learned React, of course and the skills to work with other strangers! I helped with pull requests, code reviews (first time) and offered tech suggestions to others.

I don't think I would've done any differently because if not for the mistakes we wouldn't be able to learn!

Reaching out others when in need is a very good resouce I'd say.

## Summary

I worked on learning Puppeteer, which is a chromium based web-scraper / automation tool, similar to Selenium but a lot easier to use. I wanted to learn it initially to build a bot to say "YO SCOTT" in a channel on Discord every day. I ended up building 3 projects (and actually a couple other in private repos) as I got more familiar with the tool, and found it really helpful. Sharing the 3 main ones here. 

1) Scott Bot - which says "Yo Scott" in a discord channel
2) A Linkedin Scraper which is able to scrape for recruiter names, titles, and Linkedin links 
3) A fake email injector to give me infinite coins on a networking website called Lunchclub AI so that I can generate infinite points to target my networking

## Inspiration

I always wanted to get into automation tool, and while I was first thinking of ideas for the CodeWithFriends, I kept seeing the Yo Scott channel, and thought, why don't I make something to do this for me everyday and share a happy quote b/c the channel is so chill. Which lead me down a rabbit hole of puppeteer bots. 

## Challenges

The main challenges that I faced were captchas. I definitely could have downloaded a Github Repo to beat captchas if I wanted to one day deploy any of these in a real manner and have it running 24/7 but b/c I didn't really need to have that happen, and didn't really want to figure out how to feed captchas into a captcha solver, I thought it would be easier if the programs could just run to an attached instance of a chrome browser, or just add a delay so a human can manually solve a captcha like the Linkedin Scraper project did. 

## Reflections

(1. What did you learn during this process (whether that be technical skills, or new things you learned about yourself, time management, etc?)
I learned more about dom manipulation, queries, and getting automated tasks running. Definitely, b/c I focus more on full-stack web development, it's been a while since I'ved worked on more scrappy tasks such as doing things like Puppeteer which can honestly add a lot of value quickly and easily. 

(2. What would you have done differently if you could do it again?)
I would have been less lazy and added the captcha solver, and get Scott Bot deployed on an actual server, but for now, Scott Bot will need to only live in a half-finished state, only able to ever say "Yo Scott" when someone has their computer running, and restarts the script at the beginning of the day (^_^);;;

(3. What resources did you find most helpful in working on your project?)
Youtube videos on Puppeteer and stack overflow. Doing queries in puppeteers, I found the documentation to be a bit inconsistent, but definitely as I kept testing, I began to figure it out, especially b/c when u hover over things in console debug mode you can see the name of things like: button.xyz, and I began to use those names instead of chaining query commands like: queryall(buttons).queryall(xyz), etc. 

# Overall Impression:
Out of 10 Konas, I give it a 10/10 Kona(s) :) this was a great experience and loved watching the stream to get work done. Even though real life did eventually catch up to me, I learnt a new skill, and though I wished that I took Scott Bot to the end, the other couple projects that stemmed from Scott Bot were full functional projects in their own right.

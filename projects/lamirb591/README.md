  Special thanks to the community
  

——app concept and utility —— 
This is a networking desktop app to document and share the things you have been doing in your quarantine 
When making a post you have the option to evaluate how was your day ( choose from bad, good or average day) when making the post which will be translated into charts and plotting,
By which you can look up the quality of your quarantine journey and compare it to the communities.

And it also works good as a souvenir, you can have all the activities you have done during that time saved in a speciefic environment 

— technologies used—-
Java (fx mainly), MySQL, math plotting (using jfree chart)

—- overall experience —-
Really enjoyed the process and the challenge 
It was good being a part of the community and having the motive to be consistant with something.
I had some difficulties here and there, in return the learning curve was really good

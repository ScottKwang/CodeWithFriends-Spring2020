First a little bit of background. My name is Richard Jim√©nez, I'm a 17 years old who is supposed to graduate this years of school,I'm from Dominican Republic and with everything that's happening right now I was a little sad and out of my mind lately but when I saw the video of Mayuko explaning Code With Friends I saw some kind of way to keep my mind busy.

## Inspiration

I thougth of some app I really wish would exist and so i thought of an app that let's you consult the menu of restaurants from your phone because at least in from where I am there's not a good way for duing that, in most cases you will need to call the restaurants in order to get those kinds of info.

## Setup
If you wanna try this app you can build the code or download the [apk here](https://estud-io.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/app-debug.apk).<br>
First you need to know that the app is made with cordova so...


```js
npm install -g cordova

npm install

// To build the app for android
cordova platform add android 

cordova build android
```



## Here is a screenshot of how the app looks like.

Please don't be too harsh with the look of the UI, I know it is not the prettiest in the world but keep in mind that this is my first attempt of making and app and I don't know much about frontend design or anything related.

## Reflections

* During this time I learn a little bit more of javascript and also learned a few thing of python that i didn't knew

* I also learn Go or Golang (how ever you like to called) and I loved it. If I could I would rewrote the entire api on Go instead of python

# PutAside, A Web-app for managing the rest time

Created by Nima Tavassoli, https://nimtaa.github.io  
Source code: https://github.com/Nimtaa/Put-Aside

## Summary
Whenever you are doing deep work, some sudden tasks may come into your mind such as listening to a podcast, watching a talk, checking something, and so on. With the help of PutAside, one can "put aside" his/her these kinds of tasks, and determines each required time. While resting for x minutes, the app suggests task(s) according to x.  

The focus would not be affected, and the rest time would be managed :coffee:

## Inspiration

I enjoy creating stuff, and I wanted to enhance my productivity during this time.
Then I found CWF as an opportunity  to contribute and practice coding a web app!

Thank you for organizing this event!

## Challenges

Working with a new technology as a super beginner programmer was pretty challenging. I think with a little more time/experience I could have made the app work as intended, but I found myself running into many tech issues along the way. -->

## Reflections

(1. What did you learn during this process (whether that be technical skills, or new things you learned about yourself, time management, etc?)
I enjoy coding! It's fun to see stuff come to life. I do think that moving forward though I want to keep coding as a fun side-hobby instead of trying to pursue it professionally in tandem as I grow my UX/UI design skills. But maybe in the future there will be an opportunity to become a design unicorn ðŸ¦„âœ¨

(2. What would you have done differently if you could do it again?)
I think I would have stuck with normal Swift and UIKit and tried to get my Swift foundations down a bit better. I would also try to work on it a little more consistently, instead of working mostly during the coding streams.

(3. What resources did you find most helpful in working on your project?)
The coding streams were SO helpful and fun. I really appreciate and value the sense of community :)

Thanks for organizing this whole event! I had a lot of fun and learned a lot and would definitely do it again. :) -->

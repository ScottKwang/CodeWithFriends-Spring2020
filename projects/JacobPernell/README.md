# Meditation App! (will think of a real name later lol)

## Summary

I started working on an iOS audio-based meditation app, inspired by a previous design project I worked on in my UX bootcamp. :)

## Inspiration

I enjoy dabbling in code and had a little experience using Swift. I wanted to learn SwiftUI so I thought this would be a fun opportunity to practice coding an iOS app!

## Challenges

Working with a new technology as a super beginner programmer was pretty challenging. I think with a little more time/experience I could have made the app work as intended, but I found myself running into many tech issues along the way.

## Reflections

(1. What did you learn during this process (whether that be technical skills, or new things you learned about yourself, time management, etc?)
I enjoy coding! It's fun to see stuff come to life. I do think that moving forward though I want to keep coding as a fun side-hobby instead of trying to pursue it professionally in tandem as I grow my UX/UI design skills. But maybe in the future there will be an opportunity to become a design unicorn ðŸ¦„âœ¨

(2. What would you have done differently if you could do it again?)
I think I would have stuck with normal Swift and UIKit and tried to get my Swift foundations down a bit better. I would also try to work on it a little more consistently, instead of working mostly during the coding streams.

(3. What resources did you find most helpful in working on your project?)
The coding streams were SO helpful and fun. I really appreciate and value the sense of community :)

Thanks for organizing this whole event! I had a lot of fun and learned a lot and would definitely do it again. :)

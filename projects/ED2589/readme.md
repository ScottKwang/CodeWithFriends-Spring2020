## Summary

I made an Automate-Your-Wardrobe app using the Tkinter and Pillow modules in Python. The app can keep a comprehensive inventory of the user's wardrobe, with the goal of saving the user from the morning hassle of going through closets n' drawers trying to figure out what to wear (as if there needs to be more decision fatigue), as well as empowers users to diversify their outfits and discover clothing combos they might not have thought of before using a 'randomize-your-outfit' feature.

## Inspiration

This idea has been brewing in my mind for a while - thought it would be neat to implement in the short time frame we have.

## Challenges

The logic behind packing widgets into frames, button logic.

## Reflections
Youtube, Tkinter documentation and tutorials.

## Summary

What I did this month for Code With Friends, was that I created a Fitbit Clock Face for Fitbit watches. I used my personal fitibt ionic to display my project. I used the Fitbit Developer software provided on the Fitbit website to program my ionic watch. The code I used to develop the fitbit watch was JavaScript, CSS, and Scalable Vector Graphics. <br>

This was my final product that I produced for the fitbit watches.

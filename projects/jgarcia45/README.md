## Summary

*(Write a short, 1-2 paragraph summary of what you did for Code With Friends this month)*

What I did this month for Code With Friends, was that I developed a Fitbit Clock Face called Yosemite. The clock face is meant for Fitbit watches to decorate your watch. The clock face displays your steps, time, date, and battery status. I used my own personal fitibt ionic to test and display my clock face. I developed the clock face under the Fitbit Developer software provided on the Fitbit website. The code I used to develop the fitbit watch was JavaScript, CSS, and Scalable Vector Graphics. <br>

*(Insert any pictures or screenshots of your final project here)*

This was my final product that I produced for the fitbit watches. On the top left corner is the battery status, the middle is the date. On the right side is the number of steps taken. In the center of the clock face is the time. The photo background is an actually photo I took during my visit to Yosemite. The photo is displaying the mountain known as Half Dome.

## Inspiration

*(What inspired, motivated, or urged you to work on this project specifically?)*

What inspired me to work on this project was that I myself own a fitbit watch. When I would scroll through the fitbit store to look at the different clock faces, I was fascinated with the different designs that people were creating. I thought that it would be really cool to make one myself for personal use and for others to have. I wanted others to enjoy the fitbit clock faces as much I do. So I decided to look up on how to create my own clock face. 

## Challenges

*(What challenges did you encounter - technical, mental, logistical, physical - while working on your project?)*

Some of the challenges that I encountered was that I did not really know where to start. I had trouble displaying the steps the watch counted as well how to read the input of steps your watch counted. I had to read the documentation that fitbit provided to get a better understanding on reading data and displaying it on the clock face.

## Reflections

*(1. What did you learn during this process (whether that be technical skills, or new things you learned about yourself, time management, etc?)*

What I learned in this process when it came to technical skills was JavaScript, some CSS, and how SVG files worked. Working on this project also taught me how to managed time. I would dedicate 3-4 hours a day working on the project as well as reading documentation on how to code for the fitbit clockfaces. <br>

*(2. What would you have done differently if you could do it again?)*

I don't think I would have done anything differently considering that I will continue to work on creating many different fitbit clock faces. This project was for me to get an idea on how to create one and where to begin creating them. I hope to create better clock faces as I will continue to come up with different ideas.

*(3. What resources did you find most helpful in working on your project?)*

The resources that I found most useful was the fitbit documentation provided by fitbit themselves, as well as some github respositories that explained on how to access certain data on the fitbit watches.

This project is for students at my university selecting the courses for future semesters with less work by utilizing various features, such as schedule visualization, filter course by various categories, etc.

## What is this project for?
The **problem** with the current process of selecting the courses through university website is that the **amount of work and time that students need to take to find the courses that fit the student’s major/needs is intense.** This project’s objective is to reduce the process of selecting the courses for future semesters by offering a variety of features to the user.

## Inspiration
Many first-year students are having a hard time searching for classes through the current website that the university offered. I was the one too, who didn’t know what to do, or where to go for searching classes. I don't want anybody to get through this pain again just for searching up courses.

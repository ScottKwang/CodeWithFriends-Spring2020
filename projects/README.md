## Inspiration

I mainly just built this for myself to store wallpapers, memes etc. Also felt like my friends would like something like this

## Challenges

A self-imposed goal I had was to try and build this as fast as possible to improve my focus while maintaining quality and attention to detail. I think I spent probably ~10 hours on this which I'm pretty happy with

## Reflections

Stackoverflow answers weren't very good and I wasted a bunch of time fixing something really dumb caused by the code I copied. I'll think twice before blindly copy/pasting something

## Summary

I created a Pomodoro plus White Noise web application using Node and React. A user can customize the timer to be the right interval for them up to one hour. There are options to choose any sort of audio that a user would like to listen to while focusing on their tasks. Once the timer ends if there was audio playing it will stop, and there is an option to check if a user wants an audio alert when the timer has ended. Other customization options such as background images have been added for a user to select.

## Inspiration

I had never heard of the Pomodoro technique until watching Mayuko's streams. I like the concept and wanted to build something with respect to that idea. I knew during this event I wanted to learn a new technology, and React has been one I have been meaning to learn for a while so I figured this was the perfect time.

## Challenges

I am in the process of job searching so I did not get to spend as much time as I was hoping to on the project, but I enjoyed the time I did get to join the stream and code with friends. Also, there is also that learning curve of learning a new technology, but I love learning new things so I found the challenge to be fun.

## Reflections

1. I learned React during this event. As well as implementing the Pomodoro technique especially during the streams really helped me to focus on my tasks.

2. Hopefully next time I can commit more time to the event and build something a bit bigger a bit more robust.

3. Using a timer to breakdown periods in which to focus was very helpful. Also, some reasources on YouTube were very helpful with learning React.

## Simple Inventory project of mine WIP (since I dont know much how inventory works.)


A SPA web based inventory I made based on my knowledge in how inventory system works. It is still WIP because I dont know much of how inventory proccess works. I've deployed this project on aws in this url http://13.250.234.47:88/. I used Laravel framework as a backend for this project, Vuejs for the front end and Laravel websockets for real time notifications. I integrated vue in laravel since I dont have much knowledge about vue. And also it makes me easier to code when both frontend and backend codes are in the same directory.

## Summary 
[movieRec](https://movierec-cwf.herokuapp.com/) is a recommendation web application created from scratch for Code With Friends 2020 event. It uses a 'tinder'-based approach to gather ratings for movies, and displays a movie based on a basic recommendation algorithm. This concise rating-and-recommending approach allows for a quick solution to the age-old question: "What movie should I watch tonight?"

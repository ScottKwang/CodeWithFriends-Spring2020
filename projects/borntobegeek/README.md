# Kana Card

I wanted to make a simple flashcard app for learning and practicing both hiragana and katakana and also the "double kanas" called y≈çon. Please see the demo video to see the app in action.

## Room for improvement
- In the last minute before submitting the app, I realised that the layout breaks in landscape. I unchecked landscape orientation in build options.
- I also had to disable iPad as a build target, as the navigation view I am using works completely differently there.
- I was experimenting with a card flip animation, however I found it tiring after a few cycles. I do want to research more animation options.
- I want to improve the general looks of the app. Right now it's stock iOS which lacks personality.
- I'd like to code a better, "smart" random generation function with less repetition.

All in all, I am pretty happy with what I could create in a short few days despite being out of practice. I hope you'll like it!

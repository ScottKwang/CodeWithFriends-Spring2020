## What is Pomodoify?
Pomodoify is my submission for CodeWithFriends! It's a relaxing and simple productivity app to boost your efficiency through the Pomodoro Technique and a rewarding progression system to make it fun and engaging.

## Upcoming changes
There was a lot of things I didn't have time to implement before the deadline, so I will continue to work on the project!

- More achievements and new forms of progression
- User page streaks/latest achievement
- Firebase integration
- Polish

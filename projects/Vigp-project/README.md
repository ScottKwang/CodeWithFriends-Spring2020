## Summary

BingeSquad was basically an app I build to work a bit with the new version of rails 6. On BingeSquad, you can publish or join event with random people in order to watch a movie, a series or even anime.

The owner as the role create an event and on the day of it, you can join his discord and he'll stream the movie.

Basic and lot of work ... I know, I only had a month and it was for fun and education. But you meet fantastic people with this hard work "insert winky face"

With BingeSquad you can met new people during those hard time around one of your favorite movie or watch that damn movie that have been collecting dust at the bottom of this mystical list of yours or that one you were not able to find anywhere.

(Insert any pictures or screenshots of your final project here)

## Inspiration

I really like to watch movie with my friend and girlfriend, using a streaming plateforme. I saw on reddit people hosting events for some movies like this and here we are.

## Challenges

No challenge what so ever, just trying to find some time with my new semester, who tought that an engineer course would take so much time ....

## Reflections

(1. What did you learn during this process (whether that be technical skills, or new things you learned about yourself, time management, etc?)
Learn a few things about rails 6.

(2. What would you have done differently if you could do it again?)
Not much, just plan more ahead.

(3. What resources did you find most helpful in working on your project?)

... Music hahaha, joke aside discord offer lots of cool things, sadly didn't had much time to explore, maybe i could've find some way to reduce the workload for the event owner.

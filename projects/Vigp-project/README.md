## Summary

BingeSquad is an app I built to work with the new version of rails 6. On the app you can publish or join events with random people, from watching a movie, to binging your favourite series, even an episode of an anime.

Sadly, The app doesn’t do all the work. The event’s creator must add a discord link for users to use on the day of the gathering in order to join the platform and watch the movies. The owner manages everything on discord.

Basic and a lot of work ... I know. I only had a month and it was for fun and an educational experience. But you meet fantastic people from with this hard work "insert winky face"

With BingeSquad you can meet new people during these trying times and bond over your favourite movies. Or watch that dang film that has been collecting dust at the bottom of some mystical list, maybe that old show you just can’t find anywhere.

## Inspiration

I really like to watch movies with my friends using a streaming platform. I saw the same method of hosting events for movies on Reddit, and here we are

## Challenges

No challenge whatsoever. The biggest issue was trying to find some time during my   new semester, I was never able to assist on Muko's café. Who thought that an engineering course would take so much of my time...

## Reflections

(1. What did you learn during this process (whether that be technical skills, or new things you learned about yourself, time management, etc?)

I learned a few things about rails 6 for sure. I also haven’t started a project on my own, outside of school in a while, I realize that now I have a more methodical way of approaching things and I'm way more thoughtful of the choices that I make

(2. What would you have done differently if you could do it again?)

Not much, just plan more ahead. Maybe in a more professional context, I would do more research on users and how the service can help them and if they find the concept interesting or not.

(3. What resources did you find most helpful in working on your project?)

... Music hahaha, jokes aside, discord offers lots of cool things, sadly I didn't have much time to explore those, maybe I could've found some way to reduce the workload for the event owner.

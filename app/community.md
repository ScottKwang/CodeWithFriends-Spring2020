One of the core tenants of this event is the community! We want everyone to help, support, and get excited about each other's projects. The more people we have participating in the community, the more fun it will be!

#### Discord

Join our [Discord](https://discordapp.com/invite/bpHFFWx) server and check out the **Code With Friends** category. There'll be channels where people can mingle and ask each other for help.

#### Weekly Check-ins

Every Sunday evening, we'll check in to the `#check-ins` channel on Discord to record what we've been working on, and what's next. Think of this as a standup update! This is great for accountability, and will be an easy way to ask others for help and keep everyone up to date on how things are going.

#### Coworking Sessions

Mayuko will be hosting co-working sessions on [Twitch](https://twitch.tv/hellomayuko) every Friday and Saturday from [1-4PM](https://www.thetimezoneconverter.com/?t=1PM&tz=San%20Francisco&), where she'll be working on her own project and play some chillhop music to work to. Come hang out to co-work and hang out in the chat!
